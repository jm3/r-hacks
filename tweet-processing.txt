README.PRE-PROCESSING - NOTE: ORDER OF STEPS IS SIGNIFICANT #FML

for tweets: start with tweetbackup csv file
strip out leading twitter URL format from tweetbackup retaining only the tweet ID (so we can check it for favorites later)
use SEARCH() and FIND() functions in spreadsheet to detect presence + position of:
 * hashtags
 * mentions
 * replies
 * RTs
 * links

in exported file, replace ,"" with ,"
join double-lined tweets (ugh)
strip leading "jm3: " from tweets
format dates as YYYY-MM-DD with custom format
format times as 24-hour format with custom format
strip all commas + single quotes in tweets (this will affect the length count)
pad dates + time + tweet columns with QQ so we can vi replace them faster with quotes

for favorites: start with API json export
use google refine to pivot into CSV
hack shit-ass month name abbrevs into zero-pad numbers and add - to dates
